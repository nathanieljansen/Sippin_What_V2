# Sippin_What_V2
SipThis is a Wine and Food Pairing Web Application. This application makes it easier to plug in a food item in the search bar and the app will provide you with the type of wine that pairs well with the food selection that was made. The app also provides with information about other comparable wines that you can pick if you do not like the first wine choice presented by the application. Along with that, the app presents the end user with the list of liquor stores in the area where the end user is at currently.
